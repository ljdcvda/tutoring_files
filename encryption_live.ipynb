      "distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I\n",
      "abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of\n",

      "land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more\n",

      "you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest\n",
      "boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure\n",
      "you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong\n",

      "weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think\n",
      "the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\n",
      "promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular\n",

      "about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that\n",
      "everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way- either\n",
      "in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the\n",
      "universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's\n",
      "shoulder-blades, and be content.\n",

      "  Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point\n",

      "single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers\n",
      "themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world\n",
      "between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most\n",
      "uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\n",
      "us. But being paid,- what will compare with it? The urbane activity\n",
      "with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that\n",

      "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,\n",
      "if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part\n",
      "the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand\n",

      "suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt\n",

      "capering about most obstreperously.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and\n",
      "though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates\n",
      "by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making\n",
      "as much noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since\n",
      "the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate\n",
      "(though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative is\n",
      "concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He\n",
      "stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest\n",
      "like a coffer-dam. I have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face\n",
      "was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature,\n",
      "I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw\n",
      "no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes,\n",
      "however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some\n",
      "reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry of \"Bulkington!\n",
      "Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of the house in\n",
      "pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\n",
      "entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\n",
      "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for\n",
      "sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do\n",
      "ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you\n",
      "have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and\n",
      "sleep in your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated\n",
      "the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being\n",
      "a harpooneer, his linen or woolen, as the case might be, would not\n",
      "be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all\n",
      "over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight- how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.- I shan't\n",
      "sleep with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"- feeling of the knots\n",
      "and notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\n",
      "plane there in the bar- wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\" So\n",
      "saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first\n",
      "dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while\n",
      "grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last\n",
      "the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The\n",
      "landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's\n",
      "sake to quit- the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know\n",
      "how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine\n",
      "plank. So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing\n",
      "them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his\n",
      "business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot\n",
      "too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot\n",
      "too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches\n",
      "higher than the planed one- so there was no yoking them. I then placed\n",
      "the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the\n",
      "wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down\n",
      "in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over\n",
      "me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds\n",
      "in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him- bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not\n",
      "to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea but\n",
      "upon second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the\n",
      "next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer\n",
      "might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Still looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began\n",
      "to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\n",
      "against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must\n",

      "mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an\n",
      "uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my\n",

      "confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak\n",
      "out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall\n",
      "be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the\n",
      "first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about\n",
      "selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this\n",
      "harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman;\n",
      "and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me\n",

      "criminal prosecution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty\n",

      "\n",
      "  This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\n",

      "of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a\n",
      "cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",

      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big\n",

      "night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near\n",
      "breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along\n",
      "here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a\n",

      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now; and good night to ye.\" I turned round\n",
      "from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\n",
      "the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking\n",
      "a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\n",
      "hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\n",
      "large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt\n",
      "in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish\n",
      "bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\n",
      "standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible\n",
      "to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round\n",
      "an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this\n",
      "mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be\n",
      "possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and\n",
      "parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I\n",
      "put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and\n",
      "thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my\n",
      "pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed,\n",
      "and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken\n",
      "crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and\n",
      "could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze,\n",
      "and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when\n",
      "I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from\n",
      "me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the\n",
      "knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.\n",
      "I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some\n",
      "time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished,\n",
      "however, he turned round- when, good heavens; what a sight! Such a\n",
      "face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck\n",
      "over with large blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought,\n",
      "he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut,\n",
      "and here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced\n",
      "to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could\n",
      "not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.\n",
      "They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to\n",
      "make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I\n",
      "remembered a story of a white man- a whaleman too- who, falling\n",
      "among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that\n",
      "this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met\n",
      "with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It's\n",
      "only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then,\n",
      "what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean,\n",
      "lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of\n",
      "tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical\n",
      "tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a\n",
      "purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;\n",
      "and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon\n",
      "the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like\n",
      "lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some\n",
      "difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and\n",
      "presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with\n",
      "the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of a room,\n",
      "he then took the New Zealand head- a ghastly thing enough- and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag. He now took off his hat- a new beaver hat-\n",
      "when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on\n",
      "his head- none to speak of at least- nothing but a small scalp-knot\n",
      "twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for\n",
      "all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood\n",
      "between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than\n",
      "ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\n",
      "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\n",
      "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\n",
      "him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\n",
      "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\n",
      "enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\n",
      "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face, his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as a parcel of dark green frogs\n",
      "were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\n",
      "he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a\n",
      "whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I\n",
      "quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too- perhaps the heads of\n",
      "his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine- heavens! look at that\n",
      "tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "  But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went\n",
      "about something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced\n",
      "me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the color of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and\n",
      "that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it\n",
      "must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For\n",
      "now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the\n",
      "papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a\n",
      "tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a\n",
      "very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling\n",
      "but ill at ease meantime- to see what was next to follow. First he\n",
      "takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket,\n",
      "and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",

      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",

      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",

      "one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it\n",
      "for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at\n",
      "the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not\n",

      "  The Counterpane\n",
      "\n",
      "  Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles; and\n",
      "this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in\n",
      "sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times- this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt,\n",
      "they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of\n",
      "weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "  My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n",
      "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n",
      "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\n",
      "The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or\n",
      "other- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen\n",
      "a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the\n",
      "afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in year in our hemisphere.\n",
      "I felt dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt\n",
      "worse and worse- at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me\n",
      "a good slippering for my misbehaviour: anything indeed but\n",
      "condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But\n",
      "she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had\n",
      "to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a\n",
      "great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it- half steeped in\n",
      "dreams- I opened my eyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
      "For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the\n",
      "most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\n",
      "that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
      "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\n",
      "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\n",
      "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often\n",
      "puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in the strangeness, to\n",
      "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm\n",
      "thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly\n",
      "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n",
      "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm- unlock\n",
      "his bridegroom clasp- yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\n",
      "tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove\n",
      "to rouse him- \"Queequeg!\"- but his only answer was a snore. I then\n",
      "rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and\n",
      "suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane,\n",
      "there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were\n",
      "a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here\n",
      "in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!\n",
      "\"Queequeg!- in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by\n",
      "dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the\n",
      "unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort\n",
      "of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew\n",
      "back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from\n",
      "the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me,\n",
      "and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came\n",
      "to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about\n",
      "me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing\n",
      "him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly\n",
      "observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed made\n",
      "up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were,\n",
      "reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain\n",
      "signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he\n",
      "would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the\n",
      "whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the\n",
      "circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is,\n",
      "these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will;\n",
      "it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n",
      "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so\n",
      "much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n",
      "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions;\n",
      "for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\n",
      "Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and\n",
      "his ways were well worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "  He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very\n",
      "tall one, by the by, and then- still minus his trowsers-  he hunted up\n",
      "his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but\n",
      "his next movement was to crush himself- boots in hand, and hat on-\n",
      "under the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\n",
      "inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\n",
      "propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private when\n",
      "putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in\n",
      "the transition stage- neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just\n",
      "enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\n",
      "possible manners. His education was not yet completed. He was an\n",
      "undergraduate. If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\n",
      "probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but\n",
      "then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\n",
      "getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his hat\n",
      "very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking\n",
      "and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots,\n",
      "his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones- probably not made to order\n",
      "either- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a\n",
      "bitter cold morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure\n",
      "that Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and\n",
      "boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\n",
      "somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\n",
      "possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that\n",
      "time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\n",
      "Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\n",
      "ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat,\n",
      "and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table,\n",
      "dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was\n",
      "watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\n",
      "takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\n",
      "stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\n",
      "striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\n",
      "scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this\n",
      "is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered\n",
      "the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel\n",
      "the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long\n",
      "straight edges are always kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\n",
      "of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting\n",
      "his harpoon like a marshal's baton.\n",

      "\n",
      "  However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too\n",

      "upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\n",
      "congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\n",
      "chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\n",
      "whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been a\n",
      "sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\n",
      "dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father\n",
      "Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of\n",
      "old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among\n",
      "all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a\n",
      "newly developing bloom- the spring verdure peeping forth even\n",
      "beneath February's snow. No one having previously heard his history,\n",
      "could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\n",
      "interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\n",
      "peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\n",
      "he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\n",
      "and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat\n",
      "ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\n",
      "almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\n",
      "absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed,\n",
      "and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed\n",
      "in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and\n",
      "since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle\n",
      "with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the\n",
      "chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father\n",
      "Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a\n",
      "perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a\n",
      "boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel\n",
      "with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder,\n",
      "which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany\n",
      "color, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it\n",
      "was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the\n",
      "foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental\n",
      "knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then\n",
      "with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over\n",
      "hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the\n",
      "case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds\n",
      "were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first\n",
      "glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\n",
      "for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\n",
      "For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the\n",
      "height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\n",
      "deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was\n",
      "deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for\n",
      "this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\n",
      "unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\n",
      "signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\n",
      "worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and\n",
      "wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\n",
      "self-containing stronghold- a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\n",
      "perennial well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings. Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\n",
      "was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\n",
      "beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\n",
      "snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\n",
      "clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\n",
      "forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distant spot of\n",
      "radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate\n",
      "now inserted into Victory's plank where Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\"\n",
      "the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and\n",
      "bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are\n",
      "rolling off- serenest azure is at hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\n",
      "likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's\n",
      "fiddle-headed beak.\n",
      "\n",
      "  What could be more full of meaning?- for the pulpit is ever this\n",
      "earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\n",
      "leads the world. From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is\n",
      "first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From\n",
      "thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\n",
      "favorable winds. Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not a\n",

      "In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely\n",
      "and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\n",
      "frontiers. So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's\n",
      "purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\n",
      "and it's assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\n",
      "but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear\n",
      "with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent\n",

      "there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\n",
      "about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked\n",
      "within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\n",
      "his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\n",
      "his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that\n",

      "the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the\n",

      "Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at\n",
      "all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made\n",
      "no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle\n",
      "of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon\n",
      "second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was\n",
      "a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn,\n",
      "that is- which was the only way he could get there- thrown among\n",
      "people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter;\n",
      "and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost\n",
      "serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.\n",
      "Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had\n",
      "never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true\n",
      "philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so\n",
      "striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself\n",

      "gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary\n",

      "sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my\n",

      "some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\n",

      "he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass\n",
      "through when she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef;\n",
      "on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that\n",
      "grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these\n",
      "thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle\n",

      "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\n",
      "wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\n",
      "told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage-\n",
      "this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put\n",

      "gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at\n",

      "happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\n",
      "were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\n",

      "under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to\n",
      "the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it\n",
      "round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the\n",
      "spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into\n",
      "the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat,\n",
      "Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\n",
      "living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\n",
      "like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\n",
      "turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\n",
      "looked at the grand and glorious but saw no one to be saved. The\n",
      "greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\n",
      "water, Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and\n",
      "seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A\n",
      "few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and\n",
      "with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up.\n",
      "The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\n",

      "remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\n",
      "acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with\n",
      "a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\n",
      "settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving\n",
      "Queequeg shut up with in our little bedroom- for it seemed that it was\n",
      "some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and\n",
      "prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could\n",
      "find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\n",
      "could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles- leaving Queequeg, then,\n",
      "fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\n",
      "sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\n",
      "After much prolonged sauntering, and many random inquiries, I learnt\n",
      "that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages- The\n",
      "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-dam, I do not know the\n",
      "origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod you will no doubt remember,\n",
      "was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now\n",
      "extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the\n",
      "Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on\n",
      "board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided\n",
      "that this was the very ship for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "  You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
      "know;- square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such\n",
      "a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the\n",
      "old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\n",
      "claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\n",
      "typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was\n",
      "darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt\n",
      "and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts- cut\n",
      "somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n",
      "overboard in a gale- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the\n",
      "three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and\n",
      "wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\n",
      "Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities,\n",
      "were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\n",
      "business that for more than half a century she had followed. Old\n",
      "Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\n",
      "another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the\n",
      "principal owners of the Pequod,- this old Peleg, during the term of\n",
      "his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\n",
      "inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\n",
      "his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\n",
      "chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open\n",
      "bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\n",
      "teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\n",
      "hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks\n",
      "of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning\n",
      "a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller;\n",
      "and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow\n",
      "lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered that\n",
      "tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his\n",
      "fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most\n",
      "melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\n",
      "at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\n",
      "tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\n",
      "limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\n",
      "of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\n",
      "circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\n",
      "other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy\n",
      "fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie\n",
      "Sachem's head. A triangular opening faced towards the bows of the\n",

      "\n",
      "  And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\n",
      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\n",
      "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\n",
      "all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\n",

      "most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the\n",
      "Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of\n",
      "the minutest wrinkles interlacing round eyes, which must have arisen\n",
      "from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking\n",
      "to windward;- for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\n",

      "and the Pequod was as good a ship as any- I thought the best- and\n",
      "all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he\n",

      "\n",
      "  \"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added- \"come\n",

      "  Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along with\n",
      "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\n",
      "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\n",
      "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\n",
      "each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\n",
      "nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\n",
      "whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\n",
      "stocks bringing in good interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\n",
      "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\n",
      "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\n",
      "by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\n",
      "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\n",
      "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\n",
      "Scripture names- a singularly common fashion on the island- and in\n",

      "Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\n",
      "adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\n",
      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And\n",
      "when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\n",
      "with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\n",
      "stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\n",
      "waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north,\n",
      "been led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\n",
      "nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\n",
      "voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\n",
      "help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\n",
      "language- that man makes one in a whole nation's census- a mighty\n",
      "pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all\n",
      "detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\n",
      "circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling\n",
      "morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great\n",
      "are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young\n",
      "ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not\n",
      "to do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man,\n",
      "who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of\n",
      "the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\n",
      "whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg- who cared not a rush for what\n",
      "are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\n",
      "things the veriest of all trifles- Captain Bildad had not only been\n",
      "originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\n",
      "Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\n",
      "unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn- all that had not\n",
      "moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\n",
      "altered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness,\n",
      "was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\n",
      "Peleg. Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\n",
      "against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\n",
      "Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\n",
      "had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\n",
      "leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\n",
      "the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not\n",
      "know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\n",
      "had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\n",
      "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\n",
      "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin boy in short\n",
      "clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad\n",
      "shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate,\n",
      "and captain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before,\n",
      "had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active\n",
      "life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days\n",
      "to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
      "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\n",
      "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\n",
      "sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\n",
      "he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never\n",
      "used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\n",
      "inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them.\n",
      "When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently\n",
      "looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could\n",
      "clutch something- a hammer or a marrling-spike, and go to work like\n",
      "mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness\n",
      "perished before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his\n",
      "utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare\n",
      "flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to\n",
      "it, like that worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the\n",
      "decks was small; and there, bolt upright, sat old Bildad, who always\n",
      "sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat-tails. His\n",
      "broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\n",
      "drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\n",
      "seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have\n",
      "been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to\n",
      "my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away\n",
      "at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\n",
      "Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I\n",
      "said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a\n",
      "chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink\n",
      "before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think\n",
      "it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\n",
      "willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the\n",
      "whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\n",
      "captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and\n",
      "that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance\n",
      "pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company. I was\n",
      "also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be\n",
      "very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer\n",
      "a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\n",
      "had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay- that is, the\n",
      "275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\n",
      "might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\n",

      "found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and\n",
      "reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was\n",
      "vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my\n",
      "no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in\n",
      "these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to\n",

      "It was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the\n",
      "magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\n",
      "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n",

      "voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a\n",
      "schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic\n",
      "Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly\n",
      "eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by\n",
      "this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a\n",
      "termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had\n",
      "not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so\n",
      "downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half\n",
      "the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up\n",

      "\n",
      "  Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to\n",
      "sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But\n",
      "previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw\n",
      "it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had\n",
      "nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I\n",
      "would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the\n",
      "candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg- not four feet off- sitting\n",
      "there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark;\n",
      "this made me really wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the\n",
      "same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary,\n",
      "unaccountable Ramadan!\n",
      "\n",
      "  But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till\n",
      "break of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg,\n",
      "as if he had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the\n",
      "first glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff grating\n",
      "joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;\n",
      "pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's\n",
      "religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or\n",
      "insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it\n",
      "also. But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a\n",
      "positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an\n",
      "uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take\n",
      "that individual aside and argue the point with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into\n",
      "bed now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the\n",
      "rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the\n",
      "various religions of the present time, during which time I labored\n",
      "to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged\n",
      "ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for\n",
      "the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious\n",
      "laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in\n",
      "other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it\n",
      "pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably\n",
      "foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I,\n",
      "fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all\n",
      "thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is\n",
      "the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy\n",
      "notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I,\n",
      "rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested\n",
      "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\n",
      "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take\n",
      "it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a\n",
      "great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great\n",
      "battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock\n",
      "in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I\n",
      "knew the inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a\n",
      "sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was\n",
      "the custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all\n",
      "the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,\n",
      "they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a\n",
      "pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their\n",
      "mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his\n",
      "friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not\n",
      "more than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would;\n",
      "and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the\n",
      "true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\n",
      "a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\n",
      "piety.\n",
      "\n",
      "  At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously\n",
      "hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should\n",
      "not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board\n",

      "him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\n",
      "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the\n",
      "king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of\n",
      "fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a\n",
      "house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten\n",

      "it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those\n",
      "garden-chairs which are convertible into walking sticks; upon\n",
      "occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a\n",

      "man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure\n",
      "tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and\n",
      "embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian,\n",

      "to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a\n",

      "seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious\n",
      "for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild\n",
      "watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\n",
      "superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\n",
      "organization seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\n",
      "from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his.\n",
      "And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much\n",

      "outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be\n",
      "foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales\n",

      "would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And\n",

      "There are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "  First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of\n",
      "Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some\n",
      "quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In\n",
      "his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate\n",
      "the whales from the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down\n",
      "to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against\n",
      "Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession\n",
      "of the same seas with the Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the\n",
      "whales from the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their\n",
      "warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their moveable eyelids, their\n",
      "hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally,\n",
      "\"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends\n",
      "Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of\n",
      "mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the\n",
      "reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely\n",
      "hinted they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old\n",
      "fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to\n",
      "back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what\n",
      "internal respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above,\n",
      "Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief they are these: lungs\n",
      "and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come. To be short, then,\n",
      "a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him.\n",
      "However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\n",
      "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\n",
      "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\n",
      "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but\n",
      "a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the\n",
      "tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a\n",
      "horizontal position.\n",
      "\n",
      "  By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto\n",
      "identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on\n",
      "the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively\n",
      "regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting and horizontal\n",
      "tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of cetology. Now,\n",
      "then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a\n",
      "place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on\n",
      "ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of\n",

      "whale-fleet.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is\n",
      "evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two\n",
      "centuries and more ago, the command of a whale-ship was not wholly\n",
      "lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between\n",
      "him and an officer called the Specksynder. Literally this word means\n",
      "Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief\n",
      "Harpooneer. In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to\n",
      "the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the\n",
      "whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or\n",
      "Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery,\n",
      "under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official\n",
      "is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At\n",
      "present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but\n",
      "one of the captain's more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon\n",
      "the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage\n",
      "largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an\n",
      "important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances\n",
      "(night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck\n",
      "is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands,\n",
      "that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast,\n",

      "\n",
      "  Now, the grand distinction between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this- the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\n",
      "merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\n",
      "so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\n",
      "the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\n",

      "Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family\n",
      "party. His were the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have been\n",
      "the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\n",
      "must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\n",
      "he helped himself at the table, doubtless, never more would he have\n",

      "strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped\n",
      "himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\n",
      "Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether\n",
      "he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of\n",
      "its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that,\n",
      "on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a\n",
      "premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was,\n",
      "Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n",

      "  Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and\n",
      "Flask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was\n",
      "badly jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start\n",
      "of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the\n",
      "rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to\n",
      "have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his\n",
      "repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than\n",
      "three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\n",
      "precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted\n",
      "in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an\n",
      "officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be\n",
      "otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much\n",
      "relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and\n",
      "satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach. I\n",
      "am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned\n",
      "beef in the fore-castle, as I used to when I was before the mast.\n",
      "There's the fruit of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\n",
      "there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere\n",

      "\n",
      "  Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first\n",

      "inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or\n",
      "rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And\n",
      "then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its\n",

      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the\n",
      "progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the\n",
      "standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\n",
      "tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole\n",
      "life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the\n",

      "seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his\n",
      "hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion of his\n",
      "colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an\n",
      "African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great\n",
      "negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed\n",
      "hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could\n",
      "keep up the vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a\n",

      "the abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed\n",
      "in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants\n",
      "made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of\n",
      "the lip in eating- an ugly sound enough- so much so, that the\n",
      "trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth\n",
      "lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing\n",
      "out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the\n",

      "  The Mast-Head\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with\n",
      "the other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may\n",
      "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\n",
      "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage\n",
      "she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her- say, an empty\n",
      "vial even- then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last! and not\n",
      "till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does\n",
      "she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is\n",
      "a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\n",
      "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\n",
      "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless,\n",
      "by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all\n",
      "Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as\n",
      "that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board,\n",
      "in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these\n",
      "Babel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians\n",
      "were a nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the\n",
      "general belief among archaeologists, that the first pyramids were\n",
      "founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by\n",
      "the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those\n",
      "edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs,\n",
      "those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for\n",
      "new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail,\n",
      "or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous\n",
      "Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in\n",
      "the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its\n",
      "summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in him we\n",
      "have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who\n",
      "was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail,\n",
      "or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally\n",
      "died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a\n",
      "lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well\n",
      "capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent\n",
      "to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight.\n",
      "There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome stands\n",
      "with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;\n",
      "careless, now, who rules the decks below, whether Louis Philippe,\n",
      "Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\n",
      "aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of\n",
      "Hercules' pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur\n",
      "beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan\n",
      "of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and even\n",
      "when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given that a\n",
      "hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire. But\n",
      "neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a\n",
      "single hail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their\n",
      "counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may\n",
      "be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of\n",
      "the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells\n",
      "us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were\n",
      "regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island\n",
      "erected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs\n",
      "ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs\n",
      "in a hen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the\n",
      "Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice\n",
      "to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now\n",
      "become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a\n",
      "whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from\n",
      "sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at\n",
      "the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene\n",
      "weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head:\n",
      "nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a\n",
      "hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if\n",
      "the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your\n",
      "legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships\n",
      "once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.\n",
      "There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\n",
      "nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls;\n",
      "the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For\n",
      "the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness\n",
      "invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling\n",
      "accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary\n",
      "excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities;\n",
      "fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you\n",
      "shall have for dinner- for all your meals for three years and more are\n",

      "  In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at\n",
      "the mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to\n",
      "be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a\n",
      "portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly\n",
      "destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted\n",
      "to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a\n",
      "bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any\n",
      "other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily\n",
      "isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of\n",
      "the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks\n",
      "(almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant crosstrees.\n",
      "Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as\n",
      "he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure, in cold weather you\n",
      "may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but\n",
      "properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than\n",
      "the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy\n",
      "tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of\n",
      "it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant\n",
      "pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not\n",
      "so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin\n",
      "encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body,\n",
      "and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat.\n",

      "  Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads\n",

      "comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\n",
      "your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\n",
      "conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this\n",
      "crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\n",

      "cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at\n",
      "that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns\n",
      "in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced\n",
      "his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were\n",

      "\n",
      "  But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even\n",

      "after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes\n",
      "among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a\n",

      "themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in\n",
      "his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and\n",
      "tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:-\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a\n",

      "D'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\n",

      "if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\n",
      "lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\n",
      "inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of\n",
      "his vitality in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the\n",
      "main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold\n",
      "with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever of\n",
      "ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked\n",

      "did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,\n",
      "and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\n",

      "naturalists- Olassen and Povelson- declaring the Sperm Whale not\n",
      "only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but\n",
      "also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for\n",
      "human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these\n",
      "or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the\n",
      "Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\n",
      "(sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively terrors,\" and\n",
      "\"often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the\n",

      "\n",
      "  So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a\n",
      "few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the\n",
      "earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard\n",
      "to induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of\n",

      "leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lances\n",
      "at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.\n",
      "That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\n",

      "\n",
      "  Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these\n",

      "number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely,\n",
      "without the specific details of any certain calamity, and without\n",
      "superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee\n",
      "from the battle if offered.\n",

      "  One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be\n",
      "linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously\n",
      "inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;\n",
      "that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and\n",
      "the same instant of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\n",
      "altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For\n",
      "as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been\n",
      "divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the\n",
      "Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,\n",
      "unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated\n",
      "the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\n",
      "especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a\n",
      "great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the\n",
      "most widely distant points.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,\n",
      "and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by\n",
      "Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the\n",
      "Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons\n",
      "darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some\n",
      "of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time\n",
      "between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.\n",
      "Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\n",
      "Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to\n",
      "the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of living\n",
      "men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain\n",
      "in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the\n",
      "wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more\n",
      "wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose waters\n",
      "were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground\n",
      "passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the\n",
      "realities of the whalemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\n",
      "knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\n",
      "escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\n",
      "should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick\n",
      "not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity\n",
      "in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his\n",
      "flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever\n",
      "be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly\n",
      "deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues\n",
      "away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough\n",
      "in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to\n",
      "strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much\n",
      "his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm\n",
      "whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out- a peculiar snow-white\n",
      "wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were\n",
      "his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,\n",
      "uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those\n",
      "who knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled\n",
      "with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his\n",
      "distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed,\n",
      "literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high\n",
      "noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam,\n",
      "all spangled with golden gleamings.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet\n",
      "his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\n",
      "terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according\n",
      "to specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his\n",
      "assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of\n",
      "dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting\n",
      "pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times\n",
      "been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either\n",
      "stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to\n",
      "their ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though\n",
      "similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means\n",
      "unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the\n",
      "White Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every\n",
      "dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as\n",
      "having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the\n",
      "minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips\n",
      "of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out\n",
      "of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,\n",
      "exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling\n",
      "in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken\n",
      "prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe,\n",
      "blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of\n",
      "the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly\n",
      "sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped\n",
      "away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned\n",
      "Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more\n",
      "seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since\n",
      "that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild\n",
      "vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his\n",
      "frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only\n",
      "all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual\n",
      "exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\n",
      "incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel\n",
      "eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and\n",
      "half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the\n",
      "beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east\n",
      "reverenced in their statue devil;- Ahab did not fall down and\n",
      "worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\n",
      "abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.\n",
      "All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of\n",
      "things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and\n",
      "cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all\n",
      "evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically\n",
      "assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the\n",
      "sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from\n",
      "Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his\n",
      "hot heart's shell upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant\n",
      "rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting\n",
      "at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,\n",
      "passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that\n",
      "tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but\n",
      "nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home,\n",
      "and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay\n",

      "howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed\n",
      "soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That\n",
      "it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that\n",
      "the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the fact\n",
      "that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and,\n",

      "  Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall\n",
      "that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of\n",
      "his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in\n",
      "the transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea\n",
      "charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating\n",
      "himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the\n",
      "various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow\n",
      "but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before\n",
      "were blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books\n",
      "beside him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which,\n",
      "on various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been\n",
      "captured or seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains\n",
      "over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for\n",
      "ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled\n",
      "brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out\n",
      "lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was\n",
      "also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his\n",
      "forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\n",
      "cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they\n",
      "were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,\n",
      "and others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans\n",
      "before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a\n",
      "view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought\n",
      "of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the\n",
      "leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out\n",
      "one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not\n",
      "so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents;\n",
      "and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food;\n",
      "and, also calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting\n",
      "him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\n",
      "almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to\n",
      "be upon this or that ground in search of his prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\n",
      "sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\n",
      "that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\n",
      "were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\n",
      "collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\n",
      "correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\n",
      "flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to\n",
      "construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\n",
      "\n",
      "  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out\n",
      "by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National\n",
      "Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it\n",
      "appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and\n",
      "portions of it are presented in the circular. \"This chart divides\n",
      "the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees\n",
      "of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\n",
      "twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of\n",
      "which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that\n",
      "have been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to\n",
      "show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been\n",
      "seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,\n",
      "the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct- say, rather,\n",
      "secret intelligence from the Deity- mostly swim in veins, as they\n",
      "are called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such\n",
      "undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any\n",
      "chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these\n",
      "cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\n",
      "surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly\n",
      "confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein\n",
      "in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces some\n",
      "few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or\n",
      "contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship's\n",
      "mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The\n",
      "sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and along\n",
      "that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known\n",
      "separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but\n",
      "in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he\n",
      "could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even\n",
      "then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\n",
      "delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\n",
      "perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\n",
      "for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\n",
      "herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\n",
      "say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\n",
      "found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\n",
      "unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true.\n",
      "In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to\n",
      "the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So\n",
      "that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example,\n",
      "on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano\n",
      "Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow that were the\n",
      "Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n",
      "corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So,\n",
      "too, with some other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed\n",
      "himself. But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and\n",
      "ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And\n",
      "where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been\n",
      "spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,\n",
      "antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or\n",
      "place were attained, when all possibilities would become\n",
      "probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next\n",
      "thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were\n",
      "conjoined in the one technical phrase- the Season-on-the-Line. For\n",
      "there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n",
      "periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the\n",
      "sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any\n",
      "one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly\n",
      "encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves\n",
      "were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the\n",
      "monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in\n",
      "the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which\n",
      "Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would\n",
      "not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact\n",
      "above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in\n",
      "the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet\n",
      "heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of\n",
      "the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her\n",
      "commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn,\n",
      "and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the\n",
      "equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait\n",
      "for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's\n",
      "sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view\n",
      "to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three\n",
      "hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval\n",
      "which, instead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a\n",
      "miscellaneous hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his\n",
      "vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds,\n",
      "should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the\n",
      "Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.\n",
      "So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Traders; any wind\n",

      "  But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it\n",
      "not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one\n",

      "individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded\n",
      "Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the\n",
      "peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump,\n",
      "could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale,\n",
      "Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till\n",
      "long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries- tallied\n",
      "him, and shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped\n",
      "out like a lost sheep's are! And here, his mad mind would run on in\n",
      "a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came\n",
      "over him! and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his\n",
      "strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure who\n",

      "whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till\n",
      "the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and\n",
      "when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him\n",
      "heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in\n",

      "escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of\n",
      "being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright\n",

      "\n",
      "  First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of\n",
      "Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw\n",
      "spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm\n",

      "their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being\n",
      "made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\n",
      "shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were\n",
      "necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\n",

      "  \"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next\n",
      "day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather\n",
      "was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were\n",
      "obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very\n",
      "little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the\n",
      "northwest sprang up. An uncommonly large whale, the body of which\n",
      "was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the\n",
      "water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment\n",
      "when the ship, which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it\n",
      "was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus\n",
      "placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting\n",
      "up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water. The\n",
      "masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below\n",
      "all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck upon\n",
      "some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the\n",
      "utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf applied immediately to\n",
      "the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage\n",
      "from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely\n",
      "uninjured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\n",
      "question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\n",
      "adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\n",
      "Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I\n",
      "have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in\n",
      "Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by\n",
      "no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and\n",
      "purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\n",
      "sailed from home.\n",

      "the modern Juan Fernandes. \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about\n",
      "four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and\n",
      "fifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible\n",
      "shock, which put our men in such consternation that they could\n",
      "hardly tell where they were or what to think; but every one began to\n",
      "prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent,\n",
      "that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but\n",
      "when the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded,\n",
      "but found no ground. * * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns\n",
      "leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of\n",
      "their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was\n",
      "thrown out of his cabin!\" Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to\n",
      "an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating\n",
      "that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do\n",
      "great mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder\n",
      "if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was\n",
      "after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from\n",
      "beneath.\n",

      "  I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known\n",
      "to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In\n",
      "more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the\n",
      "assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,\n",
      "and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The\n",
      "English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his\n",
      "strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the lines\n",
      "attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to\n",
      "the ship, and secured there! the whale towing her great hull through\n",
      "the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often\n",
      "observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to\n",
      "rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful,\n",
      "deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without\n",
      "conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being\n",
      "attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that\n",
      "dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content\n",
      "with only one more and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and\n",
      "most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only\n",
      "is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain\n",
      "facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)\n",
      "are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we\n",

      "  In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian\n",
      "magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor\n",
      "and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his\n",
      "own times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best\n",
      "authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and\n",
      "unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not\n",
      "at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the\n",
      "term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was\n",
      "captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having\n",
      "destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more\n",
      "than fifty years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot\n",
      "easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what\n",
      "precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he\n",
      "destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a\n",
      "whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will\n",
      "tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had\n",
      "been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters\n",
      "connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and\n",
      "perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place\n",
      "for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have\n",
      "recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated\n",
      "instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I\n",
      "am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore\n",
      "Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as\n",
      "a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a\n",

      "muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick\n",
      "mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all\n",

      "was seen no more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for\n",
      "it, were dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up\n",
      "and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other\n",
      "boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good\n",
      "time. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it\n",

      "ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the\n",
      "inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in\n",
      "seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing\n",
      "their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the\n",
      "prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides,\n",
      "it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into\n",
      "gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman\n",
      "of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of\n",
      "the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial\n",
      "business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case\n",
      "with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may\n",
      "understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",

      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\n",
      "him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\n",
      "to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being- a\n",

      "without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads, as\n",
      "the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\n",
      "little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied, with an oath, in a\n",

      "tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\n",

      "  Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales\n",
      "\n",
      "  I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to\n",
      "the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is\n",
      "moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon\n",
      "there. It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those\n",
      "curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present\n",
      "day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set\n",
      "the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the\n",
      "whale all wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions\n",
      "will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian\n",
      "sculptures. For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when\n",
      "on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and\n",
      "on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in\n",
      "scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.\n",
      "George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license\n",
      "prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many\n",
      "scientific presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways\n",
      "purporting to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous\n",
      "cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in\n",
      "the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the\n",
      "trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were\n",
      "prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder\n",
      "then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have\n",
      "been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a\n",
      "separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu\n",
      "in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But\n",
      "though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give\n",
      "the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It\n",
      "looks more like the tapering of an anaconda, than the broad palms of\n",
      "the true whale's majestic flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\n",
      "painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the\n",
      "antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing\n",
      "Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\n",
      "of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting\n",
      "the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one whit\n",
      "better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on\n",
      "the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of\n",
      "howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the\n",
      "billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate leading\n",
      "from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus\n",

      "one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\n",

      "the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\n",
      "black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\n",
      "Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\n",

      "\n",
      "  Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\n",
      "entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though\n",
      "not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic;\n",
      "and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much\n",

      "experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one\n",
      "hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain\n",
      "nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line\n",
      "measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of\n",
      "the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe\n",

      "of densely bedded \"sheaves,\" or layers of concentric spiralizations,\n",
      "without any hollow but the \"heart,\" or minute vertical tube formed\n",
      "at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the\n",
      "coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's arm, leg, or\n",
      "entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line\n",

      "  In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n",

      "course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat\n",
      "to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist\n",
      "its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common\n",
      "safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way\n",
      "attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to\n",
      "the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he\n",

      "case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
      "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\n",
      "upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against\n",
      "his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they\n",
      "alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or\n",

      "then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms\n",
      "(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it\n",
      "continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is\n",
      "then attached to the short-warp- the rope which is immediately\n",

      "carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel\n",
      "after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which\n",
      "he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold\n",
      "watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is\n",

      "for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\n",
      "upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out\n",
      "in a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and\n",
      "commanded the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto,\n",
      "whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the\n",
      "sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness\n",
      "with which he declared these things;- the dark, daring play of his\n",

      "of much practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work\n",
      "except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been\n",
      "rid of him; but apprised that that individual's intention was to\n",
      "land him in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith\n",
      "opened all his seals and vials- devoting the ship and all hands to\n",
      "unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried out. So\n",
      "strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at last\n",

      "this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain\n",

      "higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was\n",
      "at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good\n",
      "pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them\n",
      "fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes\n",
      "rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem\n",

      "this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against\n",
      "attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in\n",
      "his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a\n",
      "being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.\n",
      "But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted\n",
      "from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to\n",
      "encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let\n",
      "him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations\n",
      "and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his\n",
      "boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\n",
      "perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one\n",
      "iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,\n",
      "was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth\n",
      "prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his\n",
      "divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's\n",
      "bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his\n",
      "wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance\n",
      "for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by\n",
      "its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the\n",
      "bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of\n",
      "furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc\n",
      "in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\n",

      "hunting of the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with\n",
      "added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he\n",

      "took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split\n",
      "the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the\n",

      "  In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\n",
      "there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\n",
      "are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\n",
      "staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything\n",
      "has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who\n",
      "endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way\n",
      "a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the\n",
      "whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole\n",
      "there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and\n",
      "weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was\n",
      "inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as\n",
      "harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose\n",
      "referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the\n",
      "harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or\n",
      "stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies\n",
      "almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated\n",
      "upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\n",
      "poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the\n",
      "water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the\n",
      "occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume- a\n",
      "shirt and socks- in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to\n",
      "uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him,\n",
      "as will presently be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the\n",
      "bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my\n",
      "cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble\n",
      "scramble upon the dead whale's back. You have seen Italian\n",
      "organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the\n",
      "ship's steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by\n",
      "what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a\n",
      "strong strip of canvas belted round his waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\n",
      "proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\n",
      "ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\n",
      "leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\n",
      "were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then\n",
      "both usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it\n",
      "should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese\n",
      "ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;\n",
      "nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the\n",
      "hempen bond entailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation\n",
      "then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly\n",
      "to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint\n",
      "stock company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound;\n",
      "and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into\n",
      "unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\n",
      "interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\n",
      "so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering- while I jerked\n",
      "him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\n",
      "to jam him- still further pondering, I say, I saw that this\n",
      "situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that\n",
      "breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this\n",
      "Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker\n",
      "breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in\n",
      "your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you\n",
      "may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances\n",
      "of life. But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,\n",
      "sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.\n",
      "Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the\n",

      "\n",
      "  *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the\n",
      "Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\n",
      "improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\n",
      "than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the\n",
      "strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\n",
      "monkey-rope holder.\n",
      "\n",
      "  I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\n",
      "whale and the ship- where he would occasionally fall, from the\n",
      "incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only\n",
      "jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made\n",
      "upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly\n",
      "allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass-\n",
      "the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed\n",
      "them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible\n",
      "were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\n",
      "miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\n",
      "ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to\n",
      "them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and\n",
      "then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of\n",
      "what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark- he was provided with still\n",
      "another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages,\n",
      "Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of\n",
      "keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they\n",
      "could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\n",
      "disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best\n",
      "happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and\n",
      "from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half\n",
      "hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs\n",
      "would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall. But poor Queequeg, I\n",
      "suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook- poor\n",
      "Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life\n",
      "into the hands of his gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew\n",

      "chance to study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but, there\n",
      "is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the\n",
      "Right Whale's sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense\n",
      "superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present\n",
      "instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color\n",
      "of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large\n",
      "experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a\n",
      "\"grey-headed whale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads- namely, the\n",
      "two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side\n",
      "of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if\n",
      "you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you\n",
      "would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it\n",
      "to the magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it\n",
      "is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no\n",
      "more than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the\n",
      "whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,\n",
      "for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey\n",
      "objects through your ears. You would find that you could only\n",
      "command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\n",
      "side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest\n",
      "foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad\n",
      "day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he were\n",
      "stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so\n",
      "to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for\n",
      "what is it that makes the front of a man- what, indeed, but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "  Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the\n",
      "eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so\n",
      "as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar\n",
      "position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by\n",
      "many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a\n",
      "great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course,\n",
      "must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ\n",
      "imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this\n",
      "side, and another distinct picture on that side; while all between\n",
      "must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in\n",
      "effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two\n",
      "joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly\n",
      "impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing\n",
      "always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the\n",
      "reader in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning\n",
      "this visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content\n",
      "with a hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of\n",
      "seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically\n",
      "seeing whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's\n",
      "experience will teach him, that though he can take in an\n",
      "undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible\n",
      "for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things-\n",
      "however large or however small- at one and the same instant of time;\n",
      "never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. But if you\n",
      "now come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a\n",
      "circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in\n",
      "such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be\n",
      "utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,\n",
      "then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n",
      "simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n",
      "combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of\n",
      "time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\n",
      "him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then\n",
      "is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",

      "\n",
      "  It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",

      "are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some\n",

      "hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes\n",

      "all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you\n",
      "not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing\n",
      "upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of\n",

      "upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing\n",
      "that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great\n",

      "toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\n",

      "little but the dense tendinous wall of the well- a double welded,\n",
      "hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea\n",
      "water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the\n",
      "tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present\n",
      "instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head\n",

      "a sunbeam! Hurrah!- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a\n",
      "mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a\n",
      "tilbury on a plain- makes the wheelspokes fly, boys, when you fasten\n",
      "to him that way; and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you\n",

      "  But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\n",
      "tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew\n",
      "round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in\n",
      "them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding\n",
      "would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,\n",
      "they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\n",
      "last- owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks\n",
      "of the boat, whence the three ropes went straight down into the\n",
      "blue- the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water,\n",
      "while the three sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon\n",
      "ceasing to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude,\n",
      "fearful of expending more line, though the position was a little\n",
      "ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost in this\n",
      "way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it is called; this hooking up\n",
      "by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that\n",
      "often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the\n",
      "sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing,\n",
      "it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it\n",
      "is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays\n",
      "under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the\n",
      "enormous surface of him- in a full grown sperm whale something less\n",
      "than 2000 square feet- the pressure of the water is immense. We all\n",
      "know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up\n",
      "under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden\n",
      "of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of\n",
      "ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One\n",
      "whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle\n",
      "ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its\n",
      "depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that\n",
      "silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and\n",
      "wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were\n",
      "visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin threads\n",
      "the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight\n",
      "day clock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the\n",
      "creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said- \"Canst thou fill\n",

      "as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so\n",
      "that every oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in\n",
      "great part from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a\n",

      "of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\n",

      "instantly shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one\n",
      "of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire non-valvular structure\n",
      "of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as\n",
      "a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\n",
      "system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\n",
      "water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\n",
      "pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\n",
      "blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\n",
      "he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;\n",
      "even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is the\n",
      "well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even now, when the\n",
      "boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying\n",
      "flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by\n",
      "steady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing,\n",
      "while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals,\n",
      "however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the air. From this\n",
      "last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far\n",
      "been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part\n",
      "of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\n",
      "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\n",
      "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes\n",
      "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to\n",

      "and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to\n",
      "light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to\n",
      "illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional\n",
      "inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood, at last\n",

      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with\n",
      "swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their\n",
      "glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat\n",
      "and marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so\n",
      "spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the\n",
      "wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with\n",
      "his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning\n",
      "world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and\n",
      "died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen\n",
      "hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain,\n",
      "and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and\n",
      "lowers to the ground- so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the\n",
      "body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By\n",
      "very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\n",
      "transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\n",
      "stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially\n",
      "upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It so chanced that almost upon first him with the spade, the\n",
      "entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,\n",
      "on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps\n",
      "of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\n",
      "whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\n",
      "of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\n",
      "been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account\n",
      "for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact\n",
      "of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried\n",
      "iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone\n",
      "lance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian\n",
      "long before America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "  What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\n",
      "to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.\n",
      "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\n",
      "the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\n",
      "ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms\n",
      "with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from\n",
      "it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\n",
      "fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to\n",
      "cast them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To\n",
      "cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep\n",
      "gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory\n",
      "inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places,\n",
      "by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were\n",
      "brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift\n",
      "from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the\n",
      "submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment\n",
      "whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the\n",
      "ship seemed on the point of going over.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be\n",
      "in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do\n",
      "something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your\n",
      "handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and\n",
      "cut the big chains.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\n",
      "slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of\n",
      "sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.\n",
      "With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,\n",
      "the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all\n",
      "their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason\n",
      "assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity\n",
      "in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter\n",
      "in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and\n",
      "swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush\n",
      "and May of life, with all their panting lard about them! even these\n",
      "brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
      "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down,\n",
      "twenty Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt\n",
      "imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the\n",
      "Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than\n",
      "a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there\n",
      "are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,\n",
      "the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the\n",
      "reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to\n",
      "a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A\n",
      "line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore\n",
      "Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right\n",
      "Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of\n",

      "it when it shall have ascended again.\n",

      "Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because\n",
      "of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's\n",
      "spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful\n",

      "  Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in\n",
      "the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this\n",
      "historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some\n",
      "sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox\n",
      "pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the\n",
      "whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those\n",
      "traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts,\n",
      "for all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "  One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the\n",
      "Hebrew story was this:- He had one of those quaint old-fashioned\n",
      "Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which\n",
      "represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head- a peculiarity\n",
      "only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale,\n",
      "and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen\n",
      "have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his swallow is so\n",
      "very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is\n",
      "ready. It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah\n",
      "as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part\n",
      "of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For\n",
      "truly, the Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of\n",
      "whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too,\n",
      "Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second\n",
      "thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\n",
      "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely\n",
      "in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric\n",
      "juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a\n",
      "German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the\n",
      "floating body of a dead whale- even as the French soldiers in the\n",
      "Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into\n",
      "them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental\n",
      "commentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa\n",
      "ship, he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by,\n",
      "some vessel with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly\n",
      "called \"The Whale,\" as some craft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\"\n",
      "the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have there been wanting learned\n",

      "Jonah merely meant a life-preserver- an inflated bag of wind- which\n",
      "the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.\n",
      "Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had\n",
      "still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember\n",
      "right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea,\n",
      "and after three days' he was vomited up somewhere within three days'\n",

      "  But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet\n",
      "within that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried\n",
      "him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the\n",
      "passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another\n",
      "passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would\n",

      "  Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
      "contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n",
      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all\n",
      "times is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a\n",
      "herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head\n",
      "above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which\n",
      "gives him regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live\n",
      "by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\n",
      "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he\n",
      "cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary\n",
      "attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet\n",
      "beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n",
      "connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle\n",
      "alone; and this is on the top of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with\n",
      "the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think\n",
      "I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific\n",
      "words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man\n",
      "could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils\n",
      "and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he\n",
      "would then live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is\n",
      "precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by\n",
      "intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing\n",
      "a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of\n",
      "air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and\n",
      "on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved\n",
      "Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he\n",
      "quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood.\n",
      "So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries\n",
      "a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the\n",
      "waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in\n",
      "its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth\n",
      "is indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is\n",
      "reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider\n",
      "the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his\n",
      "spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If\n",
      "unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will\n",
      "continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other\n",
      "unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy\n",
      "times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises\n",
      "again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a\n",
      "minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so\n",
      "that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his\n",
      "regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,\n",
      "will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark,\n",
      "however, that in different individuals these rates are different;\n",
      "but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist\n",
      "upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir\n",
      "of air, ere descending for good? How obvious it is too, that this\n",
      "necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal\n",
      "hazards of the chase. And not by hook or by net could this vast\n",
      "leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\n",

      "is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the\n",
      "downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water,\n",
      "therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying,\n",
      "that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then\n",

      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\n",
      "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\n",
      "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\n",
      "this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the\n",
      "spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or\n",
      "whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth,\n",
      "and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\n",
      "indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\n",
      "proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\n",
      "spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to\n",
      "be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm\n",
      "Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout\n",
      "even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time\n",
      "him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an\n",
      "undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary\n",
      "periods of respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak\n",
      "out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can\n",
      "you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so\n",
      "easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things\n",
      "the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost\n",
      "stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist\n",
      "enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water\n",
      "falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to\n",
      "get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the\n",
      "water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should\n",
      "think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do\n",
      "you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how\n",
      "do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially\n",
      "lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit\n",
      "of the whale's head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the\n",
      "mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a\n",
      "dromedary's in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small\n",
      "basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will\n",
      "sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious\n",
      "touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him\n",
      "to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go\n",
      "with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For\n",
      "even when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds\n",
      "of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly\n",
      "smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know one,\n",
      "who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\n",
      "scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled\n",
      "off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is\n",
      "deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it\n",

      "  The Tail\n",
      "\n",
      "  Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the\n",
      "antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights;\n",
      "less celestial, I celebrate a tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that\n",
      "point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it\n",
      "comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty\n",
      "square feet. The compact round body of its root expands into two\n",
      "broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less\n",
      "than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes\n",
      "slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\n",
      "leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of\n",
      "beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of\n",
      "these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the\n",
      "tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:- upper,\n",
      "middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and\n",
      "running crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure,\n",
      "as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of\n",
      "old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to\n",
      "the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those\n",
      "wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\n",
      "much to the great strength of the masonry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not\n",
      "enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and\n",
      "woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side\n",
      "the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with\n",
      "them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the\n",
      "confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a\n",
      "point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nor does this- its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\n",
      "graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates\n",
      "through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive\n",
      "their most appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs\n",
      "beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything\n",
      "imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take\n",
      "away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in\n",
      "the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman\n",
      "lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was\n",
      "overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a\n",
      "Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father in\n",
      "human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they may\n",
      "reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\n",
      "hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\n",
      "successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all\n",
      "brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine\n",
      "one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded,\n",
      "form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that\n",
      "whether wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be\n",
      "the mood it be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding\n",
      "grace. Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\n",
      "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in\n",
      "sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts\n",
      "in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It\n",
      "never wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To\n",
      "the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\n",
      "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\n",
      "this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the\n",
      "monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale\n",
      "only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless,\n",
      "in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his\n",
      "tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from\n",
      "it, and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the\n",
      "unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke\n",
      "is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand\n",
      "it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\n",
      "through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of\n",
      "the whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib\n",
      "or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally\n",
      "the most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often\n",
      "received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play.\n",
      "Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the\n",
      "whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this\n",
      "respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of\n",
      "the elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action\n",
      "of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes side to side upon the surface of the\n",
      "sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary\n",
      "touch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\n",
      "bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the\n",
      "flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels,\n",
      "and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is\n",
      "that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail;\n",
      "for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded in the\n",
      "fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security\n",
      "of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast\n",
      "corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as\n",
      "if it were a hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The\n",
      "broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air! then smiting\n",
      "the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would\n",
      "almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the\n",
      "light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\n",
      "would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the\n",
      "flukes lies considerably below the level of his back, they are then\n",
      "completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to\n",
      "plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet\n",
      "of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a\n",
      "moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime\n",
      "breach- somewhere else to be described- this peaking of the whale's\n",
      "flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated\n",
      "nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\n",
      "spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I\n",
      "seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from\n",
      "the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in\n",
      "all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur\n",
      "to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the\n",
      "mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I\n",
      "once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the\n",
      "sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it\n",
      "seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of\n",
      "the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire\n",
      "worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\n",
      "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\n",
      "devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\n",
      "elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\n",
      "uplifted in the profoundest silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the\n",
      "trunk of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which\n",
      "they respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a\n",
      "terror to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk\n",
      "is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the\n",
      "elephant's trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the\n",
      "measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes,\n",
      "which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire\n",
      "boats with all their oars and crews into the air, very much as an\n",

      "  *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the\n",
      "whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular\n",
      "the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog\n",
      "does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some\n",
      "points of curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well\n",
      "known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk,\n",
      "and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my\n",
      "inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,\n",
      "though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\n",
      "inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\n",
      "these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared\n",

      "by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there\n",

      "strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.\n",

      "never will. But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how\n",

      "he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,\n",

      "steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\n",
      "like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",

      "vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither,\n",

      "of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly\n",
      "floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these\n",
      "Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the\n",
      "pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced\n",

      "in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some\n",
      "one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three\n",
      "minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish\n",
      "darted blinding spray in faces, and then running away with us like\n",
      "light, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a\n",
      "movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances,\n",
      "is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or\n",
      "less anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous\n",
      "vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper\n",

      "\n",
      "  As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer\n",
      "power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to\n",
      "him; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced\n",
      "as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our\n",
      "beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and\n",
      "striving to steer through complicated channels and straits, knowing\n",
      "not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering\n",
      "off from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging\n",
      "away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while\n",
      "all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking\n",
      "out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for\n",
      "there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite\n",
      "idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They\n",
      "chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. \"Out of the\n",
      "way, Commodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose\n",
      "bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us.\n",
      "\"Hard down with your tail, there!\" cried a second to another, which,\n",
      "close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his own\n",
      "fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  All whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances, originally\n",
      "invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of\n",
      "wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross\n",
      "each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is\n",
      "then attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the\n",
      "line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It\n",
      "is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then,\n",
      "more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one\n",
      "time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may,\n",
      "then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at\n",
      "once, you must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at\n",
      "your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drug, comes\n",
      "into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first\n",
      "and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales\n",
      "staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance\n",
      "of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain\n",
      "and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard\n",
      "the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat,\n",
      "and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the\n",
      "oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him. On\n",
      "both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two\n",
      "or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons,\n",
      "were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.\n",
      "So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing\n",
      "whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his\n",
      "parting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost\n",
      "heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid\n",
      "into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens\n",
      "between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this central\n",
      "expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a\n",
      "sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in\n",
      "his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which\n",
      "they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the\n",
      "distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric\n",
      "circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each,\n",
      "swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a\n",
      "ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider\n",
      "might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone\n",
      "round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing\n",
      "whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd,\n",
      "no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch\n",
      "for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had\n",
      "only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and\n",
      "calves; the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the\n",
      "revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the\n",
      "various pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this\n",
      "juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at\n",
      "least two or three square miles. At any rate- though indeed such a\n",
      "test at such a time might be deceptive- spoutings might be\n",
      "discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the\n",
      "rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if the\n",
      "cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold;\n",
      "and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from\n",
      "learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so\n",
      "young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced;\n",
      "however it may have been, these smaller whales- now and then\n",
      "visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake- evinced a\n",
      "wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed\n",
      "panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs\n",
      "they came snuffing round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching\n",
      "them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n",
      "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n",
      "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n",
      "time refrained from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and\n",
      "still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For,\n",
      "suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing\n",
      "mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed\n",
      "shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a\n",
      "considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while\n",
      "suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if\n",
      "leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing\n",
      "mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some\n",
      "unearthly reminiscence;- even so did the young of these whales seem\n",
      "looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of\n",
      "Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers\n",
      "also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that\n",
      "from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured\n",
      "some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a\n",
      "little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from\n",
      "that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\n",
      "reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the\n",
      "unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow. The delicate side-fins,\n",
      "and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited\n",
      "crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast!\n",
      "him fast!- Who line him! Who struck?- Two whale; one big, one little!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out\n",
      "hundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up\n",
      "again, and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and\n",
      "spiralling towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the\n",
      "umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed\n",
      "still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the\n",
      "chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes\n",
      "entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.\n",
      "Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this\n",
      "enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\n",
      "\n",
      "  *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\n",
      "unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\n",
      "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\n",
      "one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\n",
      "Esau and Jacob:- a contingency provided for in suckling by two\n",
      "teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the\n",
      "breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these\n",
      "precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the\n",
      "mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods.\n",
      "The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might\n",
      "do well with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the\n",
      "whales salute more hominum.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of\n",
      "consternations and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the\n",
      "centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments;\n",
      "yes, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the\n",
      "tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally\n",
      "disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe\n",
      "revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me\n",

      "\n",
      "  Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\n",
      "spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\n",
      "still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\n",
      "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where\n",
      "abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But\n",
      "the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting\n",
      "to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our\n",
      "eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than\n",
      "commonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were,\n",
      "by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by\n",
      "darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for\n",
      "hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in\n",
      "this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the\n",
      "boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the\n",
      "extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the\n",
      "revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\n",
      "battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\n",
      "spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he\n",
      "seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which\n",
      "at first the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we\n",
      "perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,\n",
      "this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed;\n",
      "he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free\n",
      "end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the\n",
      "coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had\n",
      "worked loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was\n",
      "now churning through the water, violently flailing with his flexible\n",

      "own comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\n",
      "stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\n",
      "began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted\n",
      "by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\n",
      "heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\n",
      "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\n",
      "circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\n",
      "departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\n",
      "tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up\n",
      "in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\n",

      "another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last\n",
      "swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but\n",
      "now crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre.\n",
      "This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's\n",
      "hat, who, while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had\n",

      "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\n",
      "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\n",
      "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\n",
      "but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\n",
      "whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\n",
      "had killed and waited. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\n",
      "which are carried by every boat; and when additional game is at\n",
      "hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale,\n",

      "wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's\n",
      "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\n",
      "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action\n",
      "to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he\n",
      "then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had\n",
      "originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only\n",

      "were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they\n",
      "worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but\n",
      "a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like\n",
      "so many jibbooms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work,\n",
      "and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking\n",
      "they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at\n",
      "intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of\n",
      "their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing\n",
      "tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfactories.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding\n",
      "from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction\n",
      "saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\n",
      "within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken\n",
      "himself to the Captain's round-house (cabinet he called it) to avoid\n",
      "the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n",
      "indignations at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to\n",
      "the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger\n",
      "mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited\n",
      "ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and\n",
      "unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived\n",
      "that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the\n",
      "ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise was\n",
      "quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly\n",
      "concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\n",
      "Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.\n",
      "According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover\n",
      "of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased,\n",

      "nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "  By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,\n",
      "with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton\n",
      "velvet vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was\n",
      "now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once\n",
      "ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\n",
      "\"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of\n",
      "babyish to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to\n",
      "his captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose\n",
      "captain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever\n",
      "caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I'm certain that he's no more fit to command a whale-ship\n",
      "than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried\n",
      "one, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he\n",
      "conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned\n",
      "to them.\n",

      "somebody else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service\n",
      "to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful\n",

      "down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",

      "  By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,\n",
      "hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,- that having a long tow-line\n",
      "in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out\n",
      "the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side. While the\n",
      "Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,\n",

      "Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the\n",
      "Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the\n",
      "fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he\n",
      "commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You\n",
      "would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea;\n",
      "and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was\n",
      "like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English\n",
      "loam. His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping\n",
      "their chief, and looking anxious as gold-hunters.\n",

      "  Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important\n",
      "as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born\n",
      "Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons\n",
      "on that subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively\n",
      "late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself,\n",
      "a problem to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the\n",
      "French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite\n",
      "distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also\n",
      "dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found\n",
      "except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,\n",
      "odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and\n",
      "spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious\n",
      "candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and\n",

      "after-oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become\n",
      "quite maimed; and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale;\n",
      "and therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb\n",

      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle\n",
      "in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack\n",
      "whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with\n",
      "him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the\n",
      "water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the\n",
      "line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to\n",
      "the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which\n",
      "had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt.\n",
      "He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards\n",
      "Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\" Meantime Pip's blue, choked\n",
      "face plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In\n",
      "less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was\n",
      "assailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting\n",
      "these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,\n",
      "business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip\n",
      "officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome\n",
      "advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except- but\n",
      "all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in\n",
      "general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases\n",
      "will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better.\n",
      "Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\n",
      "conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin\n",
      "to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and\n",
      "concluded with a peremptory command \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the\n",
      "Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can't afford to\n",
      "lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times\n",
      "what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don't jump any\n",
      "more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved\n",
      "his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too\n",
      "often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It\n",
      "was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but\n",
      "this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale\n",
      "started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried\n",
      "traveller's trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was\n",
      "a beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea calm and cool,\n",
      "and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\n",
      "gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and\n",
      "down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No\n",
      "boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb's\n",
      "inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In\n",
      "three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and\n",
      "Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,\n",
      "curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\n",
      "loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",

      "awful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self\n",
      "in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell\n",
      "it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea-\n",
      "mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?\n",
      "No; he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in\n",
      "his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up\n",
      "to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such\n",
      "considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity,\n",
      "is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances;\n",
      "and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the\n",
      "fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless\n",
      "detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
      "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
      "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n",
      "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;\n",
      "such, at least, they said he was. The sea had leeringly kept his\n",
      "finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned\n",
      "entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,\n",
      "where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro\n",
      "before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his\n",
      "hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile\n",
      "eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects,\n",
      "that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw\n",
      "God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore\n",
      "his shipmates called him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and\n",
      "wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that\n",
      "celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal\n",
      "or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.\n",

      "loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this\n",

      "resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only\n",
      "some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is\n",
      "otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,\n",
      "was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",

      "one of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.\n",
      "From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last\n",
      "only spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all\n",
      "bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the\n",

      "whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\n",

      "true notion of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some\n",
      "way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped\n",
      "round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.\n",
      "Still more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered\n",
      "joints; and in place of the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes,\n",
      "an utter blank!\n",
      "\n",
      "  How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man\n",
      "to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely pouring\n",
      "over his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.\n",
      "No. Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the\n",

      "no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those\n",
      "belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-hand, practical\n",
      "extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral\n",
      "to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching\n",
      "trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to\n",

      "him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was\n",
      "singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies\n",
      "continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years'\n",
      "voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his\n",
      "readiness in ordinary duties:- repairing stove boats, sprung spars,\n",
      "reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull's eyes in\n",
      "the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other\n",
      "miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special\n",
      "business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of\n",
      "conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so\n",
      "manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished\n",
      "with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of\n",
      "wood. At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was\n",
      "securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its\n",
      "hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices, and\n",
      "straightway files it smaller. A lost landbird of strange plumage\n",
      "strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\n",
      "right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the\n",
      "carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsmen sprains his\n",
      "wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for\n",
      "vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;\n",
      "screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically\n",
      "supplies the constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear\n",
      "shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears. Another has the\n",
      "toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand upon his\n",
      "bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow unmanageably\n",
      "winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the handle of\n",
      "his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if\n",
      "he would have him draw the tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike\n",
      "indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of\n",
      "ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly\n",
      "held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously\n",
      "accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all\n",
      "this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But\n",
      "not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a\n",
      "certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it\n",
      "so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it\n",
      "seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible\n",
      "world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still\n",
      "eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations\n",
      "for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,\n",
      "involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;- yet\n",
      "was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like,\n",
      "antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then\n",
      "with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass\n",
      "the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah's\n",
      "ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer,\n",
      "whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but\n",
      "what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might\n",
      "have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an\n",
      "unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living\n",
      "without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might\n",
      "almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort\n",
      "of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work\n",
      "so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been\n",
      "tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven;\n",
      "but merely by kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He\n",
      "was a pure manipulater; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have\n",
      "early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one\n",
      "of those unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo,\n",
      "Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior- though a little\n",
      "swelled- of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades\n",
      "of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,\n",
      "pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted\n",
      "to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to\n",
      "open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers,\n",
      "take him up by the legs, and there they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\n",
      "was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have\n",
      "a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow\n",
      "anomalously did its duty. What that was, whether essence of\n",
      "quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But\n",
      "there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\n",
      "more. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle\n",
      "in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the time\n",
      "soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also\n",

      "could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live\n",
      "or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He\n",
      "answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a\n",
      "man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:\n",
      "nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,\n",

      "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single\n",
      "sheaved block, to secure to the mainmast head, he received the two\n",
      "ends of the downwardreeved rope; and attaching one to his basket\n",
      "prepared, pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.\n",
      "This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the\n",
      "pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other;\n",
      "pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but\n",
      "shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the\n",

      "for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured\n",
      "the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one\n",
      "hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for\n",
      "miles and miles,- ahead astern, this side, and that,- within the\n",
      "wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place\n",
      "in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea\n",
      "is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under\n",
      "these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in\n",
      "strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because\n",
      "in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different\n",
      "relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is\n",
      "seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are\n",
      "being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but\n",
      "a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the\n",
      "hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast\n",
      "adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab's proceedings in this\n",
      "matter were not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to\n",
      "be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever ventured to\n",
      "oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to\n",
      "decision- one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he\n",
      "had seemed to doubt somewhat; it was strange, that this was the very\n",
      "man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his whole life\n",

      "ten minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often\n",
      "fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in\n",
      "these latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming\n",
      "round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it\n",
      "darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized\n",
      "downwards, and went eddying again round his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab\n",
      "seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else\n",
      "have marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now\n",

      "snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing\n",

      "any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the\n",

      "\n",
      "  The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently\n",
      "vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea\n",
      "directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the\n",

      "aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy\n",
      "between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a\n",

      "famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his\n",
      "final perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing\n",
      "just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the\n",
      "Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height\n",
      "the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\n",
      "revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\n",

      "remember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a\n",
      "point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black\n",
      "water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr.\n",
      "Starbuck; lower, lower,- quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the\n",

      "\n",
      "  Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the\n",

      "ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its\n",
      "waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the\n",
      "breathless hunter came so nigh seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his\n",
      "entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea\n",
      "as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of\n",
      "finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of\n",
      "the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft\n",
      "Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his\n",
      "broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the\n",
      "shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into\n",
      "the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright\n",
      "bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by\n",
      "the light toes of hundreds of gay fowls softly feathering the sea,\n",
      "alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising\n",
      "from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a\n",
      "recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at intervals\n",
      "one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro\n",
      "skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on\n",
      "this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "  A gentle joyousness- a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,\n",
      "invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away\n",
      "with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,\n",
      "leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching\n",
      "fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove,\n",
      "not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White\n",
      "Whale as he so divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "  On each soft side- coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him then flowed so wide away- on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters\n",
      "who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had\n",
      "ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the\n",
      "vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest\n",
      "on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that\n",
      "same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And thus, through the serene tranquilities of the tropical sea,\n",
      "among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding\n",
      "rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full\n",
      "terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched\n",
      "hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from\n",
      "the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high\n",
      "arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his\n",
      "bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded\n",
      "and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing,\n",
      "the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that\n",
      "he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "  With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
      "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he\n",
      "gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\n",
      "wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his\n",
      "eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery\n",
      "circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"The birds!- the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds\n",
      "were now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards\n",
      "began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round,\n",
      "with joyous, expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab\n",
      "could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down\n",
      "and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no\n",
      "bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and\n",
      "magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly\n",
      "revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up\n",
      "from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and\n",
      "scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the\n",
      "blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like\n",
      "an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his\n",
      "steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous\n",
      "apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,\n",
      "went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his\n",
      "crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while\n",
      "yet under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick,\n",
      "with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly\n",
      "transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his\n",
      "pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled\n",
      "for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner\n",
      "of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\n",
      "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up\n",
      "into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The\n",
      "bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of\n",
      "Ahab's head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the\n",
      "White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\n",
      "mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;\n",
      "but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to\n",
      "gain the uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "  And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as\n",
      "the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from\n",
      "his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at\n",
      "from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and\n",
      "while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\n",
      "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious\n",
      "with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all\n",
      "alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all\n",
      "this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly\n",
      "strove to wrench from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw\n",
      "slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and\n",
      "snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,\n",
      "bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in\n",
      "the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These floated\n",
      "aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck\n",
      "clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to\n",
      "lash them across.\n",
      "\n",
      "  At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the\n",
      "first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his\n",
      "head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his\n",
      "hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But\n",
      "only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over\n",
      "sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;\n",
      "spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell\n",
      "flat-faced upon the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a\n",
      "little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and\n",
      "down in the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole\n",
      "spindled body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose- some\n",
      "twenty or more feet out of the water- the now rising swells, with\n",
      "all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively\n",
      "tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So, in a\n",
      "gale, the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base\n",
      "of the Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "  *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must\n",
      "best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be\n",
      "encircling him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly\n",
      "round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his\n",
      "vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more\n",
      "deadly assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him,\n",
      "as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's\n",
      "elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in\n",
      "the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to\n",

      "offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.\n",

      "by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his\n",
      "utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms\n",
      "his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a mountain\n",
      "of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven miles and\n",

      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",

      "straight up to his forehead,- a not uncommon thing; for when within\n",
      "a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the\n",
      "whale's sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and\n",
      "while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to\n",
      "his eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost\n",

      "heedless of the iron darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent\n",

      "But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers\n",

      "themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him;\n",

      "in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then,\n",
      "twice sundering the rope near the chocks- dropped the intercepted\n",
      "fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the\n",
